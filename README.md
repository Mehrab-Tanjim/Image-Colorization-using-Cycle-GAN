# Image-Colorization-using-Cycle-GAN

 - Download the kaggle dataset as mentioned in the paper.
 - Put the dataset in a folder. Let the folder name be 'dataset'. Put the gray-scale image in
a folder named A and th ab in B. Also create a folder named 'output'. 
 - Then simply run the ipynb and the outputs will be generated.
